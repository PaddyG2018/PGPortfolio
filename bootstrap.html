    <h3>Background</h3>
      
      
    <p>As a UX designer for Latitude Finance I worked in their originations space for Credit Card and Personal Loan applications. Senior management wanted to look at how we might innovate our credit card application form using social media profiling and OCR technology for quick identity verification - with the goal to reduce the number of data fields a customer would fill out. If we could take our ‘traditional’ application that took 10 minutes to complete, with potential extra verification steps after submission, and utilise new technology to both reduce the time and verification steps - it could potentially make a huge impact to application submissions.</p>

    <p>I was asked to quickly prototype an example of what this application might look like. </p>

    <p class="pstyle">A month later I was leading the design in a multi-functional (risk, architecture, product, legal) project team that was sponsored by the CEO. With a 6 week timeline (concurrent with BAU projects), we were tasked to look at how we could use new technologies to devise an ideal state for a new personal loan application process.</p>

    <p>The process was coordinated by an external business innovation consultant using design thinking methodologies. </p>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>
      
    
        <p>We started by defining the problems, both for customers and for the business:</p> 

<ul><p>Faster & easier application: 52 data fields on the personal loan form. Could any be removed? Could any be consolidated and captured using other methods (e.g. social media)?</p></ul> 
<ul>Credit eligibility: Customers have to complete an entire application with a credit check before they find out the result (which could be negative). Is there a way we can give a good indication of credit eligibility without having to fill out an entire application and marking a customer's credit history?</ul>
<ul>Customer lending risk: Could we innovate on how we assess customers' credit risk by utilising new sources of personal data?</ul>

<p>We also used competitor analysis from around the world - looking at how lenders in the U.S. and Europe were doing things. We also asked acquaintances who had taken out a personal loan about their experience.</p>

    <p>Using a divergent/convergent (or double-diamond) approach, we brainstormed ideas and solutions with the aim of quantity over quality. Many post it notes were abused in the process.

    <p>I worked closely with the product manager to understand how we the anatomy of a loan application; simply put: what do we need to know to best understand a customer’s capacity to repay a loan?</p>


    <p>We also stripped back our understanding of why customers come to us (or any lender) for a loan: <strong>needs & motivations.</strong> This helped to create some simple cluster points to anchor our ideas and solutions with.</p>

    <h3>Week 3</h3>
      
    
    <p>We explored & chatted with international vendors who were using big data in new ways for credit scoring, including social media. We wanted to see how that might reduce the number of fields and produce the necessary information the system needed to assess credit capacity.</p> 

<p>As we were beginning to define our requirements, we white boarded a simple application UI flow and laid out the new behind the scenes mechanics.</p>

<p>I took every form field in the current application form and separated them individually, re-grouping them to see which could be answered with new ways of data capture: OCR + Big Data tools + Social Media accounts.</p> 

<ul>OCR with a driver’s license would take care of nearly 20 fields of personal information: name, DOB, address, license number as well as being a verified source of personal info.</ul>

<ul>Social media, like Linked In, could tell us about someone’s current employment status, their employment history, tenure, job title etc.</ul>

<ul>We also wanted to look into electronic Proof of Income (ePOI) as a way to verify someone’s income.</ul>

<p>I then got started on the design while we continued developing the new product/experience construct.

    <p>I decided due to time constraints and the very experimental nature of what we were exploring that I would begin with paper prototypes. We would take these into our first round of customer testing.</p>

<p>I felt that a paper prototype would reduce and remove unnecessary visual and interactive elements and allow the participant to focus on the content (questions) and their decision making (how to provide the answers).</p>

<p>I made two variations and tested with 8 participants over two days.

    <h3>Week 5</h3>
        
    
      
    
    <p>I took feedback from the first round of testing and incorporated necessary changes when moving to a high fidelity, interactive prototype for our 2nd round of testing. I used Sketch and Invision, testing again with 8 participants over 2 days.</p>
        
    <p>Incorporating social media as a means to provide information was performing poorly in testing. It needed a lot more work to address privacy and personal information disclosure concerns.</p>

        <p>The upshot was that our 'progressive disclosure' of loan eligibility and rate was testing very well; with customers loving getting an indication, albeit estimated, of how much they could borrow at what kind of rate range. It would save time for them and we hoped be a powerful acquisition pull into a full application.</p>
        
        <p>The social media was distracting participants from other elements, significantly the e-POI and 'progressive rate disclosure' features, so I removed it and went back into testing.</p>

    <h3>Week 6</h3>
      
    
    
        
        <p>I can't speak much to the outcome as I’m no longer with Latitude and certain things are business sensitive. The 6 week project was intended to explore what was remotely possible in innovating a personal loan application. It brought together expertise from all various aspects of the business who previously hadn’t been exposed to design thinking, allowing us to break free of daily and typical constraints and think about what could be. It was a fantastic exercise in devising a new and complex product and putting it in front of customers for testing fairly quickly.</p>
